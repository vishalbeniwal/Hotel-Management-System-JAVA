# CityLodge | Hotel Management System Created using JAVA

This project was done to develop a console application in the Java programming language which allows a hotel named CityLodge to manage the renting and maintenance of two types of hotel rooms: standard hotel rooms and suites. I have used JAVA FX to create a desktop app with all the functionality needed.
